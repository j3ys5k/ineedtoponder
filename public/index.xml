      <description>The Purpose of This Article Although I use the word ‘Back’ Pain… I’m going to be using it as an umbrella term for muscle, neck, and shoulder pain as well. For years now I’ve struggled with a lot of pain and tension largely from not moving enough. And so have a lot of you. Nearly everyone I’ve talked to who works a desk job at some point been troubled with back, neck, shoulder, wrist pain, or just felt crappy from being immobile for long periods.</description>
