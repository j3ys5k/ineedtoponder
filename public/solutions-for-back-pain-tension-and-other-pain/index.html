<h2 id="the-purpose-of-this-article"><strong>The Purpose of This Article</strong></h2>

<p><em>Although I use the word &lsquo;Back&rsquo; Pain… I&rsquo;m going to be using it as an umbrella term for muscle, neck, and shoulder pain as well.   For years now I&rsquo;ve struggled with a lot of pain and tension largely from not moving enough.  And so have a lot of you.  Nearly everyone I&rsquo;ve talked to who works a desk job at some point been troubled with back, neck, shoulder,  wrist pain, or just felt crappy from being immobile for long periods.</em></p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;ve seen so many people just resign themselves to living with pain, or worse chase their tails trying ineffective and often expensive solutions only to end up right back where they started.  I&rsquo;ve been researching it a long time and I wanted to put together this condensed guide for others to easily get to some of the more effective (and cost effective) solutions, without having to wade through all the misinformation out there.   Unfortunately there&rsquo;s not really a pre-defined universally agreed process that someone can go through who has back pain.  So this article will attempt to put together a practical working solution until we find out something better.</em></p>

<p><em>The solutions in this article are primarily intended for people who have <strong>NOT</strong> suffered an injury.  Basically if you were otherwise healthy, and then started to get aches and pain and muscle tension from being immobile all day this article is for you.  Your pain and tension is probably caused by lack of movement and a few other related things.   If you suffered an injury like a car accident or sports injury and are getting pain, you may require a different approach with a professional.  (But some of these approaches may overlap with your treatment.)</em></p>

<h2 id="forget-everything-you-currently-know-about-back-pain"><strong>Forget Everything You Currently Know About Back Pain!</strong></h2>

<p>One of the most frustrating things about the topic is the wealth of misinformation out there.  Society tends to act like there&rsquo;s a one true solution for back pain, but really it&rsquo;s a lot more like cancer treatment.  We really don&rsquo;t have a good understanding of how it works and there&rsquo;s not one solution that works for everyone.  There&rsquo;s a lot of hearsay….and many things that don&rsquo;t work at all.  There&rsquo;s also a lot of stuff that only partially works.</p>

<p>So much of it is straight up false information, that I encourage everyone to just throw out everything they think they know about back pain and start over from scratch (Yes really.)</p>

<p>Otherwise people will tend to fixate on common things they&rsquo;ve heard a repeated throughout our culture that don&rsquo;t actually work and it just gets in the way.  It&rsquo;s really that bad.</p>

<p>And what&rsquo;s even worse than that, many medical professionals don&rsquo;t know what works either!  They often don&rsquo;t keep up with the science, are also just as prone to the cultural hearsay as all humans are,  and have vested interests in you staying with their (often expensive) approach.  You may go to a host of professionals such as chiropractors or physical therapists that all tell you different and contradictory information.  Where can you turn?</p>

<h2 id="painscience-com-might-be-the-best-overall-site-on-the-internet-about-pain-there-is"><strong>Painscience.com Might be the Best Overall Site on the Internet About Pain There Is.</strong></h2>

<p>As far as the internet goes, it&rsquo;s an absolutely terrible resource for information on pain and muscle tension.  It&rsquo;s full of contradictory and straight up false information.  But, If I had to turn to one site for information,<a href="http://www.painscience.com"> http://www.painscience.com</a>  would be the one.   Here is a good <a href="https://www.painscience.com/reading-guide-patients.php">overall guide to the site</a>.</p>

<p>The man who runs the site&rsquo;s sole job now is full time research into the topic of pain.  His tutorials go into extreme depth into what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.  He is on the front lines of this topic and his solutions have been much more effective and cheaper than others.  The only problem I&rsquo;d say is he tends to throw out any approaches that haven&rsquo;t yet been tested yet. So he&rsquo;s not fully comprehensive.   Not all approaches have been tested equally, or at all.  But of the stuff that has been, he is a great resource.</p>

<p>##**Best Overall Solutions that Have Worked For Me  **</p>

<h3 id="painscience-com-s-model-free"><strong>Painscience.com&rsquo;s model (free)</strong></h3>

<p>Painscience.com&rsquo;s primary approach revolves around 3 seperate things that come together.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Massaging Out Trigger Points</strong> -  trigger points are basically these areas of tension in muscles that need to get massaged out for at least 30 seconds  in order for the muscle to really loosen.  You can get at them yourself, or have someone else do it (A knowledgeable massage therapist can also help a lot here, but they won&rsquo;t be able to be with you day to day).

<ul>
<li>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.painscience.com/articles/spot-01-suboccipitals.php#all_spots">list of common trigger points to massage</a> -<a href="https://www.painscience.com/articles/spot-01-suboccipitals.php#all_spots"> (don&rsquo;t need to do all of them, but focus on ones that contribute to your own problem areas) </a>.</li>
<li>Here&rsquo;s a link to a <a href="https://www.yogatuneup.com/alpha-ball/?from=GS&amp;wickedsource=google&amp;wickedid=57728621856&amp;wtm_term=&amp;wdevice=c&amp;wtm_campaign=202047456&amp;wtm_content=9272142096&amp;gclid=CMLdwKL7xcwCFQcfhgodFiIGZg">good massage ball</a> that gets at the points better than your hands.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Use Mobilizations</strong> -** (repeated simple body movements)**  to keep future tension at bay and to calm down currently agitated muscles.  You basically do high reps of very simple low intensity movements to loosen a muscle.  The high reps are key. You need anywhere from 30 - 70 reps depending on the person.  40 is probably a good number to shoot for until you get a feel for how much you need.

<ul>
<li>Here&rsquo;s an  In depth <a href="https://www.painscience.com/articles/mobilizing.php">article on mobilizations</a> and how to do them.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://ymaa.com/publishing/dvd/qigong/meridian_qigong_DVD">DVD routine of mobilizations</a> about $40 &hellip;that works really well and loosen the entire body.  This one is a one of the best routines I&rsquo;ve found for loosening the whole body, and you get a lot of bonus information on acupressure which feels awesome.</li>
<li>More Mobilizations from Tai chi. The 1st video you get in their <a href="http://www.discovertaiji.com/free-trial-registration/">3 week free trial</a> has some really great ones you won&rsquo;t get elsewhere.<br /></li>
<li>Mobilizations work better with Progressive Muscle Relaxation (see section below), the more you can consciously tell your muscles to relax while they are mobilizing the better they will work.<br /></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mobilize at a certain frequency for them to stay effective</strong> -.  You need a 20:1 ratio.  Basically if you are in a static (non moving position) for 20 mins, you need at least 1 minute of mobilization to ward off tension and pain.

<ul>
<li>Here&rsquo;s an in depth <a href="https://www.painscience.com/articles/microbreaking.php">article on how often you should mobilize</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>You want to keep the cycle of all three things going. If I don&rsquo;t do one of the three usually the cycle breaks down and stops working, especially if I&rsquo;m not working on the trigger points.</p>

<p>###<strong>What a routine might look like.</strong></p>

<p>So the overall approach would look like this.  I&rsquo;ve been sitting for about 30 mins.   I get up and use a massage ball to work on 1- 2 trigger points near my most aggravated areas for about 30 seconds each.  Then I&rsquo;ll pick a problem area to do about 40 reps of a mobilization on each.  Then back to work.    Repeat at least once every 30 mins for best results.  When really jacked up do every 20 mins.  You don&rsquo;t need to repeatedly work trigger points each time.  I&rsquo;ve found 1-3 times per day seems to be sufficient.  (I now also include some progressive muscle relaxation in this routine for my hips / neck / jaw as well.  See below)</p>

<p>##<strong>Don&rsquo;t Just Sit There ($40)</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.primalblueprint.com/dont-just-sit-there">https://www.primalblueprint.com/dont-just-sit-there</a></p>

<p>This program tries to find a solution to the problem of how to integrate movement into your daily life instead of having to always take breaks to do it. You are doing it all the time.  Adding in breaks on top of though only makes it more powerful.  They are one of the only people I&rsquo;ve seen try to address this issue in an office environment.</p>

<p>###<strong>How it Works</strong></p>

<p>Their basic approach is to switch positions as often as possible.  Ideally you would have a laptop and some space and furniture to sit and stand.   Every time you begin to get tense you switch positions.  You cycle through as many positions as possible including but not limited to sitting on the floor with legs out, kneeling, cross legged, laying down, sitting, standing, etc.</p>

<p>I’ve tried it at home and it seems to be an improvement over simply sitting or standing in one position for long periods. I was cycling through about 5-6 positions over the course of an hour and I never really got the chance to tense up.   If you couple this approach with the PainScience model, I see it is a really really powerful system.  The problems come in in how to fully do it in an office environment unless you have the right space and equipment.   Despite this, there are so many useful and sneaky and subtle tips to work in movement (especially at standing desks) I still recommend it. Especially since in the future we will have more mobility with laptops.</p>

<h3 id="alignment-and-ergonomics"><strong>Alignment and Ergonomics</strong></h3>

<p>Along with making sure you move, it&rsquo;s good to make sure that when you are not moving you aren&rsquo;t putting yourself in positions that aggravate pain.  Alignment and ergonomics is important, but usually not as important as moving enough.  Postural alignment is a pretty deep subject and beyond the scope of this article… but in general  if you align yourself and your workstation similar to the following images, it should take care of a lot of the biggest offenders in terms of posture related pain problems.  The numbers aren&rsquo;t so important as having the actual lines line up with the points on your body.</p>

<p><img src="images/Back-Pain1.jpg" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>

<h3 id="fixing-muscle-imbalances"><strong>Fixing Muscle Imbalances</strong></h3>

<p>If you find that you are doing the above stuff and you still have a lot of issues you may have a some sort of muscle imbalance.  For any given task, your body will recruit muscles to get it done. It doesn&rsquo;t really try to make sure you are using the best ones for the job though, and over time it can develop bad habits and the recruitment can snowball to where you are overworking muscles you don&rsquo;t need to use to make up for weaker ones.</p>

<p>So far<a href="http://www.suzannegross.me/"> these guys </a>are the best I have found in sussing out and working with these imbalances in the area.  The use a technique called MAT.  Here&rsquo;s a decent <a href="http://breakingmuscle.com/mobility-recovery/muscle-activation-techniques-what-is-it-and-how-can-it-benefit-me">overview</a> of it.    <br />
 <br />
They&rsquo;ve helped me cut my pain down by at least 50% so far.  I&rsquo;m continuing to work with them to see how it goes.    <br />
 <br />
The main con for them is that they are expensive.  But most treatment is.  But if you are going to pay for something, this is probably your best bet in terms of a permanent solution.  And you&rsquo;ll need less sessions the longer you do it.</p>

<h3 id="adding-breathing-mobilizations">**Adding Breathing Mobilizations  ** </h3>

<h2 id="if-there-s-still-something-missing-in-the-above-approaches-you-may-want-to-add-breathing-as-a-mobilization-it-turns-out-that-there-is-a-connection-between-proper-breathing-and-neck-and-jaw-pain-tension">If there&rsquo;s still something missing in the above approaches  you may want to add breathing as a mobilization.  It turns out that there is a connection between proper breathing and neck and jaw pain / tension.</h2>

<h2 id="https-www-painscience-com-articles-respiration-connection-php-https-www-painscience-com-articles-respiration-connection-php"><a href="https://www.painscience.com/articles/respiration-connection.php">https://www.painscience.com/articles/respiration-connection.php</a></h2>

<h2 id="most-people-don-t-breathe-properly-but-some-better-than-others-when-you-breathe-properly-you-get-a-lot-of-movement-internally-that-you-wouldn-t-otherwise-be-getting-it-stretches-out-many-things-out-and-keeps-them-mobilized-over-time-with-improper-breathing-things-can-get-tight-and-cause-imbalances-which-can-in-turn-make-the-neck-jaw-and-upper-back-tense">Most people don&rsquo;t breathe properly.   But some better than others.  When you breathe properly, you get a lot of movement internally that you wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be getting.   It stretches out many things out and keeps them mobilized. Over time with improper breathing things can get tight and cause imbalances, which can in turn make the neck, jaw,  and upper back tense. </h2>

<p><br />
 <br />
Now when I do my mobilizations I&rsquo;ve added breathing as one as well. So far it&rsquo;s payed off well and is a secret weapon in loosening the neck, throat and jaw.   Additionally it has a lot of overlapping benefits with stress reduction and progressive muscle relaxation.</p>

<h2 id="progressive-muscle-relaxation">Progressive Muscle Relaxation</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_muscle_relaxation">Progressive muscle relaxation </a>is an actual specific technique for trying to relax your muscles using your conscious mind and intent. I am referring to it in a more general sense and not the specific technique from the wiki article.  I&rsquo;ve found over time that it&rsquo;s important to be deliberate in telling your body to relax, and this can be a key component in overcoming certain issues.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>How it Works</strong></p>

<p><br />
You basically try to become more aware of what muscles are tense and consciously order them to relax.  The calmer the body is the calmer the mind is and vice versa.   <br />
 <br />
<strong>Keys to Making it Work</strong></p>

<p>I find this technique to be by far the most difficult and frustrating, but also one of the most beneficial and rewarding long term.  It takes a long time to master and there are a lot of things that stop it from working.  You&rsquo;ll progress much faster and farther if you take these into account:</p>

<ul>
<li>**Control Outside Forces - ** If you have something continuously upsetting your body ergonomically, biologically, or alignment wise you&rsquo;ll always be taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back until you fix it.  Strength training and certain sports movements if done improperly can also make it worse.  Trigger points can also be a big roadblock.  If things aren&rsquo;t working try massaging them out.  Biological factors like sleep, nutrient deficiencies and ailments can also play a role.<br /></li>
<li><strong>Spread it out instead of doing all at once</strong> - For instance, if you don&rsquo;t move at all the entire day and become super tense and then try to do it&hellip;  it&rsquo;s going to be nigh impossible to make any progress .   It&rsquo;s better to add it into your breaks throughout the day and not let things get so severe in the first place.  Longer sessions are still important too, but they will be more effective if done on top of spreading it out.</li>
<li><strong>Combine with other methods</strong> - combine it with nearly anything else in the article (especially mobilizations,breathing and MAT) and it will make it more effective.  Additionally MAT training and Tai Chi  standing meditation training help build up certain postural muscles that make it way easier for your other muscles to relax.  This helps you progress much much faster.</li>
<li>**Get Feedback -  **work with another person to show you where you are tense, and give you feedback on when you&rsquo;ve relaxed enough.  It&rsquo;s hard to understand what is tense and your body is often blind to it until it has something to compare it to.  A <a href="http://bodydialogues.com/">professional bodyworker</a> or someone who does some variation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique">alexander technique</a> can be a good fit,  or  someone who could hook you up to a biofeedback machine.<br /></li>
<li>**Tai Chi Chuan and Standing Meditations **-  One of the best ways to get feedback is by doing meditations called &lsquo;standing post&rsquo; or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhan_zhuang">Zhan Zhuang</a>. You maintain a certain posture and try to relax any non essential muscles.  The more you relax the heavier you can feel yourself become and the more weight goes into your thighs.   The added benefit is that you also strengthen postural muscles  which gives your body more confidence to relax, and you are learning to relax under duress.  The martial form of Tai Chi uses this extensively to practice relaxation, which is fundamental to making their martial art work. The 2nd video you get in their <a href="http://www.discovertaiji.com/free-trial-registration/">3 week free trial</a> goes over these well.   The main caveat here is that it is very difficult to do.  Not for the faint of heart.  But it gives more and more rewards the longer you do it and might be one of the most comprehensive and long term muscle relaxing solutions.     <br /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="don-t-forget-about-emotions-reduce-stress-and-anxiety">Don&rsquo;t Forget About Emotions.  Reduce Stress and Anxiety.</h2>

<p>Believe it or not the connection to the body and the emotions is a two way street. Whatever happens in the mind is reflected somewhere in the body.  It bears mentioning then, that coming at the problem of pain and tension from a purely physical perspective isn&rsquo;t complete.  So far I&rsquo;ve given solutions coming at things from the body side of things which I&rsquo;ve found to be a bit more tangibly effective&hellip;but there is also a mental and emotional component involved as well.</p>

<p>Whether it&rsquo;s seeing a mental health professional or making lifestyle changes…. whatever you can do to to reduce stress and anxiety mentally and bring balance to the force of your emotions will have a big effect on how your body tension is doing, and for some that will be the actual core issue.  Unfortunately this topic is beyond the scope of this article and deserves a whole book unto itself, but I have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zMbmOPUac5WXraDYUhINCaIlBKG9LrmVov0rNz6jHfs/edit?usp=sharing">link to some resources</a> that can help reduce stress and anxiety that I have compiled in the meantime.   </p>

<h2 id="toc_13"></h2>

<p>Experimental Research</p>

<p>One last thing that I&rsquo;ve found helps but my findings are still inconclusive… is that making sure you aren&rsquo;t deficient in nutrients or amino acids seems to help with tension and muscle pain.   If you go through this book  &ldquo;The Mood Cure&rdquo;, it is a very comprehensive guide to approach this.  It only works for certain people, but if you are one of those ppl it&rsquo;s worth looking into.  For me it was partially successful.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mood-Cure-4-Step-Program-Emotions-Today/dp/0142003646">https://www.amazon.com/Mood-Cure-4-Step-Program-Emotions-Today/dp/0142003646</a></p>

<h2 id="to-sum-up">To Sum Up</h2>

<p>So we&rsquo;ve covered quite a bit of material in this post.  Here&rsquo;s a recap of what we went over.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Forget What You Know About Back and Other Pains</strong></li>
<li>**Painscience.com - **Is a good way to find out what works and what doesn&rsquo;t</li>
<li><strong>Top Methods that Work For Me</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pain Science Model</strong> - trigger points, mobilizations, and frequency</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Just Sit There</strong> - change your set up so you can change positions frequently</li>
<li><strong>Alignment and Ergonomics</strong> - make sure you are avoiding postures that aggravate pain</li>
<li><strong>Fix Muscle Imbalances</strong> - find a MAT practitioner to help suss them out and correct them</li>
<li><strong>Add Breathing as  Mobilization</strong> - to help with extra upper body tensions and stress.<br /></li>
<li>**Progressive Muscle Relaxation - **learn to be more aware of your muscle tension and consciously control it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>**Don&rsquo;t Forget About Emotions **- reduce emotional stress and anxiety to have an effect on the body.<br /></li>
<li>**Experimental Research -  **try seeing if you are deficient in any nutrients or amino acids to help with tension.</li>
</ul>

<p>There&rsquo;s so much more to say on each one of these topics, but so little space. We&rsquo;ve reached the end of this article and hopefully this has provided you with some good tangible resources to tackle pain and muscle tension problems.   If anyone has questions or wants to know more feel free to reach out.</p>
